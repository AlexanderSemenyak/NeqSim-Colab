# Examples of use of NeqSim in Google Colab
NeqSim (Non-Equilibrium Simulator) is a Java library for estimation of fluid behavior and process design for oil and gas production. The basis for NeqSim is a library of fundamental mathematical models related to phase behavior and physical properties of oil and gas.

This project includes various examples of use of the NeqSim library from Google Colab.
