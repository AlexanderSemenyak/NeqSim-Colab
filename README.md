# Introduction to Gas Processing using NeqSim in Colab
NeqSim Python/Colab is part of the [NeqSim project](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/). NeqSim (Non-Equilibrium Simulator) is a Java library for estimation of fluid behavior and process design for oil and gas production. The basis for NeqSim is a library of fundamental mathematical models related to phase behavior and physical properties of oil and gas.

[NeqSim (Non-Equilibrium Simulator)](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/) is a library for estimation of fluid behaviour for oil and gas production. Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. In the notebooks listed in this page you will find examples of typical gas processing calculations using NeqSim in Colab, and will serve both as introduction to natural gas processing and to interactive use of NeqSim in a Python based notebook. The notebooks serves as a theoretical introduction and as a simulation tool for many processes found in the gas industry.

This module gives an interactive intruduction to gas processing using NeqSim and Colaboratory. The notebooks use the NeqSim package in Python and calculations are run directly from the web browser (by selecting Runtime and Run all in the main menu). The user will need to log on using their google account. To learn more about Colab see the [Welcome To Colaboratory page](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).
